# From Chaos to Clusters: A Guided Journey

Welcome to "From Chaos to Clusters"! This tutorial aims to share my step-by-step journey towards understanding clusterization and its practical applications. Whether you're new to clustering algorithms or looking to deepen your knowledge, this repository will guide you through the fundamentals, implementations, and real-world applications of clustering.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Step-by-Step Tutorials**: Clear, easy-to-follow tutorials on various clustering algorithms.
- **Code Examples**: Practical implementations in Python. 
- **Real-World Applications**: Insights into how clustering is used in different domains.
- **Resources and References**: Additional materials to expand your understanding.

## Goals

- **Learning Together**: Join me in exploring the world of clustering.
- **Practical Understanding**: Gain hands-on experience through examples and exercises.
- **Applications**: Understand how clustering can solve real-world problems effectively.


## Applications

Given my research focus on applications related to news articles, such as recommendation systems, I have dedicated all my notebooks and applications to this topic. Specifically, I will utilize the MIND-small dataset due to its pre-formatted structure, user-friendly accessibility, and extensive references available.

**Dataset Link:** [MIND-small Dataset](https://msnews.github.io/)

You can easily download the dataset using the following commands:

```bash
cd data/
chmod +x data_download.sh
./data_download.sh
```
